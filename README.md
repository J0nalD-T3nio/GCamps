# fincash_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Due to the lack of knowledge and experience in using flutter, and the different job commitment of the lead developer this project is still unfinished.
The coding practices, source code, as well as the output will show the inexperience of the lead dev.
As the lead developer I express my sincerest apologies for giving this subpar output and not being able to reflect the expectations of my teammates and being able to uphold the standards of this competition.
I am open to heavy critism and comments for self development and I would greatly appreaciate if you could give good resources for me to study and learn flutter, the documentation is quite overwhelming for me to study within four days.
